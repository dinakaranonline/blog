As we near the end of 2020 with the entire world getting into podcasting big time and podcast becoming mainstream, I do not want to become left out. Because I love to experiment with all things new and shiny. So jumping into the bandwagon and created my new podcast ‘**Master Of None**’.

_Through this Master Of None podcast, I would like to provide a running commentary on the emerging and new trends in the tech industry focussing predominantly on the intersection of cloud, programming, architecture, DevOps, machine learning and security. I hope you find the topics discussed in the podcast interesting._

I’m creating this podcast entirely through the mobile app called Anchor FM. This app helps to record and publish to podcasts to all major platforms like Spotify, Apple Podcasts and Google Podcasts. It makes the creation and publishing part relatively easier. Spotify has bought this app and is looking to become the epicentre of all things about podcasting. There are some monetisation options available for podcast creators based out of US only at this point of time.

Permission to publish to Apple podcasts is still being awaited.

I’m really curious and excited as to where this journey would lead me to. If there are any specific area/ topics that you are curious and interested to understand better, please let me know. I will try to cover as part of future episodes.

**Episodes:** 

**Welcome to Master Of None : ~ 1 min**

Hi Everyone, Welcome to my brand new podcast Master of None. I'm Dinakaran and I have been working in the IT industry for over a decade now . Through this podcast, I would like provide a running commentary on the emerging and new trends in the tech industry focussing predominantly on the intersection of cloud, programming , architecture, DevOps, machine learning and security. I hope you find the topics discussed in the podcast interesting. Let's get started .

**1.Hype Around Cloud: ~30 mins**

The Hype Around Cloud. In the last 5 to 6 years, there is a lot of hype and momentum around Cloud. A lot of traditional businesses, governments, startups and freelance developers have started using the cloud. There are a lot of job opportunities too these days. To understand the demand, it is useful to jog down the memory lane to see how applications were built before and how things have changed in the last 10 years and how Cloud is going to evolve in the next decade.

**2.The Serverless Mindset : ~ 15 mins** 

“The Serverless Mindset”. In this 15 min talk, I discuss what The Serverless Mindset is all about. What is Serverless and how do we go about architecting and designing applications leveraging the various offering from cloud and saas providers using the low code / no code and low infra / no infra mindset.

**3. Event Driven Architecture : ~ 30 mins**

Event Driven Architecture has been much talked about with the evolution of distributed systems , cloud and microservices. In this episode , we would be discussing on the challenges with the distributed system and microservices and how to build applications that are decoupled yet communicate with each other asynchronously. Also we have smart devices like sensors pushing in lot of data at scale and we need to find efficient ways to handle these as well. Discussion on the different ways of implementing Event Driven Architecture - Reactive Event Driven Systems aka Message Queue - Publisher Subscriber pattern vs Event Streaming aka Logs. We will also look at typical use-cases where each of these pattern fit and finally wrapping with pros and cons of an event driven architecture.

**4. CDN and it's evolution to Edge Computing : ~ 33 mins**

CDN Content Delivery Networks have been there for decades. In this episode, we try to understand what CDN is and the general use case where CDN may be a good fit. We also look at the main components that are available in a typical CDN. We also explore the various caching mechanisms of Push vs Pull, cache invalidation strategies . Also a brief look at different types of CDN like Public CDN vs Private CDN and Image CDN and Media CDN. We also discuss how CDN can help from security aspect, be it DDOS attack or acting as Web Application Firewall for OWASP based attacks. Finally delving into newer trends of CDN being used at a Compute level with Edge Computing with 3 main uses being 1. JAM stack for building modern server side rendered web applications 2. IOT devices that may perform small pre and post processing and deployment of AI/ML models at Edge for inference and finally 3. Edge Computing for 5G networks to serve content with milli second latency. I hope you find the topics discussed in the episode pretty useful.

**5. Infrastructure As Code - Taking DevOps CI- CD Automation to the next level ~ 18 mins**

DevOps Continuous Integration - Continuous Delivery CI CD have seen successful adoption in many places . This has helped in the automation of code integration, build and deployment . But infrastructure is always missed out in this process. In traditional on premises world, infrastructure once created will not change very often. But with Distributed Computing and Cloud, infrastructure needs to be created real time and teared down as and when required. There is no way to manually create infrastructure across regions without automating the creation of infrastructure. And these scripts have to be version controlled and treated as another piece of code . It should be part of CI- CD process as well. In this episode, I'm discussing Infrastructure as Code and why should Developers , not just DevOps engineers should care.

**6. Cloud Economics and FinOps ~ 37 mins**

As cloud adoption goes mainstream, the cost and financial impact of running services in the cloud is gaining significance. There is a mindshift change required to think of costs from Capital Expenses ( Capex ) to Operational Expenses ( Opex ) . Architecting solutions keeping the cost as an important lever is mandatory . Using tools like Cost Calculator to better predict cost is recommended. Monitoring the infrastructure to ensure the cost escalation is kept in control by means of alerts , dashboard and monitoring and optimization of resources through automation is becoming more pronounced across organization. We finally discuss on the idea of FinOps - Finance , Operations, Engineering and Senior Management coming together to collaborate and ensure each of them understand the roles and responsibilities . We discuss the main pillars of FinOps - Governance, Engineering, Reporting and Optimization.

**6. DevOps - Security is not an afterthought ~ 36 mins**

DevSecOps is a relatively new term coined that focus on the collaboration between Application Development, Operations and Security Teams coming together to deliver applications and software in an agile fashion in an iterative, faster and secure way.

In this podcast, we discuss the reason why DevSecOps have come into focus in the last few years. And for teams to start adopting DevSecOps practices, what are different aspects, perspectives and approaches that need to be considered are also briefly touched upon. 

Threat Modelling is the starting point to understand the security posture, identifying gaps and prioritize critical aspects that need attention. We also discuss the tools, technology and automation that are required for successfully building DevSecOps practices.
