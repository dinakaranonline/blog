When social media was at its peak, it became a norm to use check-in feature on Facebook or Twitter etc to let the world know the cool places that we are going or hanging out. It also became a customary tradition to take selfies or food photos with our family and friends and share them everywhere.

Post privacy awareness, some of us stopped sharing photos. Dozens of selfies were still clicked and saved for posterity, but we stopped from sharing publicly, but in private WhatsApp group etc. I have been using Google Photos for a few years now and is one of the best products rolled out by Google of late.What makes this app awesome is the 'memories' feature. It displays photos taken long back as memories and as a young parent, it gushes out a multitude of emotions watching newborn daughter slowly transforming over the years. Nostalgia is awesome.

Speaking of Nostalgia, I cannot miss recommending this MadMen pitch of The Carousel. It is one of the amazing scenes that was ever written and performed in my opinion. 

> Google Photos is not just an app, but Carousel of our life.

### **Google Photos AI-powered Tagging Feature**

Google Photos rolled out AI features in the app a couple of years back. The way it works is that all the photos that are stored on the app are analyzed and Google AI identifies them the objects, faces, landmarks in the photos and tags them accordingly. It is a wonderful feature and it helps to search for photos based on the object tags that are stored by AI. 

I and my wife had a conversation with the daughter around planning for a new movie and the discussion went around what dress she is going to wear for the cinemas. And then she told us about that the last time when we went for ['Incredibles 2'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incredibles_2) movie and that she wore a particular dress and she was able to even recollect the colour of the dress and who gifted it to her. I and my wife were awestruck by her memory but still wanted to confirm if whatever she says is true. I remember taking a picture of my daughter besides the movie poster in the cinemas. Since I had a huge stock of photos and it was a long time ago, it would have been very difficult to scroll these pictures and locate it.

### **Using AI to locate the pictures**

I thought of using the Google Photos search photos to locate the picture. I was aware that Google's AI can even read the text in the pictures as well. So here is how I went about it. 

I tried the first search keyword because I thought the search could locate text within the photo: 

**Incredibles** - no search results  

Then I tried 

**The Incredibles** - again no search results

Then I remembered how the AI tags the photos using common object properties. For eg, it tags photos with cars, bicycle, landmarks, greenery etc.

So I tried the search as 

**Poster** and voila I got a stream of search results and the photo that I wanted to locate was there as a second result. I was blown away by how quickly it was to locate the picture.

And Ladies and Gentlemen, my daughter was indeed right. She was wearing the exact same dress.

### **Possibilities of AI in Image Recognition** 

It is amazing when technology works and the underlying Google API most probably used is the [Google Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/). Try this feature by uploading images and witness how Google tags these pictures and other metadata.

As AI is improving, we are witnessing how easy it is for modern software to distinguish facial and human features and apply bokeh to improve portrait photos by blurring the background. I recently came across this new site [https://www.remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg/) that helps us remove the background from photos. It is awesome. Give it a try, the end results are mostly spot-on.

However, there are few situations when the AI messes it up. For [instance](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/12/16882408/google-racist-gorillas-photo-recognition-algorithm-ai), it tagged a human face as **Gorilla** It was early days though, but it triggered a big debate over how AI.

With AI, the possibilities are limitless, but it is equally frightening the unintended consequences.
