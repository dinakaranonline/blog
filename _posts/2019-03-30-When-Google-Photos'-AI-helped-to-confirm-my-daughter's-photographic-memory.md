# When Google Photos' AI helped to confirm my daughter's photographic memory

When social media was at its peak , it became the norm to use check-in Facebook or Twitter to let the world know the cool places that we are going out or hanging out. It also became a customary tradition to take selfies or food photos with our family and friends and share it every where.

Post the privacy awareness,  some of us stopped sharing photos. Dozens of selfies were clicked and saved for posterity, but stopped from sharing publicly, but in private WhatsApp group etc. I have been using Google Photos for few years now and is one of the best products rolled out by Google of-late. I have been using it for a quite some time and what makes this app awesome is the 'memories' feature . It displays previous photos as memories and as a young parent , it gushes out a multitude of emotions watching  new born daughter slowly transforming over the years. Nostalgia is awesome.

Speaking of Nostalgia , I cannot miss recommending this MadMen pitch of Carousel. It is one of amazing scenes that was ever written and performed in my opinion. 

> Google Photos is not just an  app,but Carousel of our life.

**Google Photos AI powered Tagging Feature**

Google Photos rolled out AI features in the app couple of years back. The way it works is that all the photos that is stored on the app is analyzed and AI identifies them as objects, faces , landmarks in the photos and tags them accordingly. It is a wonderful feature to search for photos based on the object tags that is stored by AI. 

Me and my wife had a conversation with the daughter  around planning for a new movie and the discussion went around what dress she is going to wear for the cinemas . And then she told us that the last time when we went for ['Incredibles 2'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incredibles_2) movie , she was wearing a particular dress and she was able to even recollect the color of the dress and who gifted it to her. Me and my wife were awestruck by her memory, but still wanted to confirm if whatever she says is true. I remembered taking a picture of my daughter besides the movie poster in the cinemas . Since I had a huge stack of photos and it was a long time ago , it would have been very difficult to scroll these pictures and locate it.

**Using AI to locate the pictures**

I thought of using the Google Photos search photos using tags  to locate the picture. I was aware that Google's AI can read the text in the pictures as well. So here is how I went about it. 

I tried the first search keyword because I thought the search could locate text within the photo: 

**Incredibles** - no search results  

Then I tried 

**The Incredibles** - again no search results

Then I remembered about how the AI tags the photos using  common object properties . For eg, it tags photos with cars, bicycle, landmarks, greenery  etc.

So I tried the search as 

**Poster** and voila I got a stream of search results and the photo that I wanted to locate was there as a second result. I was blown away by how quickly it was to locate the picture.

And Ladies and Gentlemen, my daughter was indeed right . She was wearing the exact same dress.

**Possibilities of AI in Image Recognition** 

It is amazing when technology works and the underlying Google API most probably used is the [Google Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) . Anyone can try the feature by uploading images and witness how Google tags these pictures and other meta data.

As AI is  improving , we can now witness how easy it is for modern software to distinguish facial and human features and apply bokeh to improve portrait photos.  I recently came across this new site [https://www.remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg/) that helps us remove background from photos. It is  awesome, give it a try, the end results are mostly spot-on.

However there are few situations when the AI messes it up. For [instance](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/12/16882408/google-racist-gorillas-photo-recognition-algorithm-ai) , it tagged a human face as **Gorilla** It was early days though , but it triggered a big debate over how AI.

With AI , the possibilities are limitless , but it is equally frightening the unintended consequences.
