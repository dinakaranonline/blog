Empathy in Design Thinking is one of the most important consideration while designing anything, especially while building mobile app.Empathy helps to understand how the user's pain point and how they can be addressed in best possible ways. It is putting ourselves in the shoes of the customers and provide User Experience that is refined, elegant and magical.

UPI is the new set of API's that is provided by consortium of banks in India through which core banking services that can be built by fintech companies. Google Pay by Google is one such app that has jumped into the bandwagon of providing core banking services by using the API's provided by the bank.

For the most part , the app is a delight to use. It works flawlessly and I use it regularly for making fund transfers to friends and families. I also use it to make bill payment for a host of different services and experience has been smooth for most part , except when it is not.

### A not-so-great User Experience 

I had a recent experience with Google Pay and it's not-so happy-flow in action. Google Pay app can be used to pay for offline transactions in shops through QR code. All that is required is to scan the QR code displayed in the shop and make the transaction from the mobile app. Whenever such payments are made, the common expectation is of these three situations :

- Payment Successful. 
- Payment failed but money credited back instantly. 
- Payment failed but money will be credited back in 2-3 days.


When the payment is successful , money is instantly credited into the seller's account, who can validate and give the good purchased.

When payment is failed, try another payment or use different mode of payment to complete the transaction. 

But what happened with Google Pay is 4th option :

- Payment processing - money debited from my account but not credited into seller's account.


So I'm  at the shop with the status of 'Payment Processing'. And the seller is unwilling to give the goods as money is not received in his account. I cannot make one more payment because am not sure if my first payment is success or failure.

### How Google Pay's customer support spectacularly fails

And this is where Google Pay's customer support is amazing. 

- There is no direct voice support to make a call and get an update on status of transaction.
- There is no option to chat with customer support through the app.
- There is no way to instantly communicate in anyways with the customer support.


What the app informs is that , transactions may take 3 days to be processed. How would such a design make sense when making payments, especially during offline transactions at a local kirana shop.

> In cases where the app takes 3 days for a transaction to process , was this important message displayed when the user is making a transaction in the first place ?

As an user , I believed it to be an instanteous real time transfer because UPI is based on IMPS where payments are real time, where the transaction is either success or failure - nothing in-between. If there was a warning message , then as a user , I would have made an informed decision whether to make the payment or not. The very reason that the message is displayed post the transaction makes me feel betrayed about the whole user experience as the app was more focussed on the happy-flow and encourage users to make payment and such messages that it make take 2-3 days to process would stop the user from making the transaction.

I left the shop informing the seller that I will come and collect the goods once the money is credited into his account.I kept waiting for 3 days but the status was still the same. I used the customer support option to give me a call back. I received no call-back.

So I used Google Pay's customer support and they told me to wait for 3 days again, which has actually passed but status of transaction is still 'Payment Processing'. The transaction had an option of raising dispute for any transactions post 3 days. I raised a Dispute Claim and processing time to settle claims was 2 weeks. In the mean time , the payment transaction status changed to Success. I had no clue when the status was changed. Should there not be various states for a transaction to clarify when was the payment processed actually ? There is no such data.

### Multiple visits to the shop to complete my shopping

With a dispute claim in process, I went to the shop again who confirmed the money is credited into his account and so I collected my purchase. But then, the dispute claim is also under process and am not sure if Google Pay will roll back the transaction thereby leading to a situation where I got the goods but transaction rolled back and I owe the seller again. I had requested for a call back in the app to inform them about payment is successful now and not to roll back based on my dispute claim , but am yet to receive the call from Google Pay customer support.

This whole user experience is bad, really bad. What should have been a basic Success or Failure type of transactions ended up me visiting the shop twice , couple of follow up with Google Pay via the app and Twitter leading to a terrible user experience.

Empathy is one of the most important user journeys during Design Thinking and some how Google Pay has missed to implement this while designing their app and user journeys. I am not sure mine was not an isolated situation. 

This also made me realize how banks handle this much better. Banks while making transactions prompt and inform users upfront about availability and processing of service upfront, good customer support via phone or email that helps to handle these kind of situation really well. Even other UPI apps like PayTM and PayPe has better customer support when compared to Google Pay.

The only question is whether Google Pay is listening or they trust's their AI and automation too much to discover such situations over an extended period of time.

Till next time.
