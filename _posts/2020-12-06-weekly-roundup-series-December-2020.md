### Curation of all interesting content that I came across in the internet for the week ending 6th December,2020

### 1. Google fired an AI ethics researcher, but what was the researcher's paper all about? 

Reading through the article , one interesting observation is the consequences of running Machine Learning Models at unprecedented levels and the environmental impact as a result of this. It should be interesting to see more people digging into this aspect in the days to come. 

" Timnit Gebru, the co-lead of Google’s ethical AI team, announced via Twitter that the company had forced her out. 
Gebru, a widely respected leader in AI ethics research, is known for coauthoring a groundbreaking paper that showed facial recognition to be less accurate at identifying women and people of color, which means its use can end up discriminating against them. She also cofounded the Black in AI affinity group, and champions diversity in the tech industry. The team she helped build at Google is one of the most diverse in AI, and includes many leading experts in their own right. Peers in the field envied it for producing critical work that often challenged mainstream AI practices."

### 2. How Microsoft crushed Slack and the obvious reason why Slack sold itself to SalesForce 

"Slack’s life as an underdog darling of Silicon Valley ended on November 2, 2016. That’s when the upstart communication startup published an open letter to Microsoft in the New York Times, offering the tech giant an insincere “welcome” to the world of workplace chat software. The occasion was Microsoft’s launch of Teams, a Slack clone that would come bundled with the company’s popular Office 365 suite of products.
In its letter, Slack warned Microsoft that “Slack is here to stay,” adding: “we’re just getting started.” But the 4 million users it had at the time would increase to just 12 million four years later, while Microsoft — which added Teams to its 365 bundle without increasing the price — took Teams from zero to 115 million users.
That disparity helps to explain why Slack sold itself this week to Salesforce. The deal, which values Slack at $27.7 billion on revenues of $833 million over the past year, has largely been greeted with cheers. (Ben Thompson offers a typically excellent rundown of the opportunity here for both Salesforce and Slack.)"

### 3. Why Enterprises are moving from TensorFlow to PyTorch for building Machine Learning Models?

TensorFlow, which emerged out of Google in 2015, has been the most popular open source deep learning framework for both research and business. But PyTorch, which emerged out of Facebook in 2016, has quickly caught up, thanks to community-driven improvements in ease of use and deployment for a widening range of use cases.

PyTorch is seeing particularly strong adoption in the automotive industry—where it can be applied to pilot autonomous driving systems from the likes of Tesla and Lyft Level 5. The framework also is being used for content classification and recommendation in media companies and to help support robots in industrial applications.

### 4. State of the Octoverse Report 2020

The State of the Octoverse explores a year of change with new deep dives into developer productivity, security, and how we build communities on GitHub. 

"This year, the pandemic forced many of us to work remotely and more of our focus was shifted to childcare, schooling, personal health, and how to try to balance it all. But as the global workplace shifted into its new reality, we also saw an increase in developer connection and camaraderie through open source. With this in mind, an important question to ask is how we make all that work sustainable. Thanks to automation and collaboration, developers have been able to communicate more effectively and increase efficiency, carving out more time to do the work that matters most."

### 5. How Tech Teams should be run more like sports teams?

"Maybe we should consider our tech teams as needing off-season, and pre-season just like a sports team. Maybe managers need to look out for individuals in case they have the equivalent of an “in-season injury”.
And yes, this is more about a mental health issue rather than about breaking legs or pulling muscles (although, bad backs people and desks people!).

Tech is often a high-stress world, and the delivery of technology projects is often at the sharp end of a business. It is often seen as the critical piece of the puzzle, and the stress levels of tech people are so often very high, and it’s why I see so much burnout. Maybe, just maybe, there’s a better way to think about it."

### 6. Walt Disney on how to truly love what you do 

"Due to individual circumstances, not everyone can aspire to the kind of work that brings out the artisan in them, but anyone can at least try to adjust their mindset with what they have. Walt Disney is one of the enduring cultural icons of the past few generations, and much of both his success and his level of fulfillment can be traced back to his craftsmanship at work. Most of us have careers that last between 30 to 50 years. That’s a significant part of life, and the only way to ensure they mean something is to treat what you do with the right intention.
There’s an artisan in all of us. Whether or not it shows through depends on our daily choices."

### 7. How Jeff Bezos makes decisions

"There are two types of decisions. There are decisions that are irreversible and highly consequential; we call them one-way doors, or Type 2 decisions. They need to be made slowly and carefully. I often find myself at Amazon acting as the chief slowdown officer: “Whoa, I want to see that decision analyzed seventeen more ways because it’s highly consequential and irreversible.” The problem is that most decisions aren’t like that. Most decisions are two-way doors."
