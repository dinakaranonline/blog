Interesting reads for the week. 

### 1. Twitter was hacked and biggest celebrity accounts were compromised. 

This week major breaking news was the news of Twitter being hacked and biggest celebrity accounts were compromised in the process.  The security incident seems to be have been perpetuated by social engineering  Twitter employees and then accessing Twitter's internal account management tools. What was scarier is that some of the biggest names have their account password reset and changed successfully. It is not very clear how 2-factor authentication was bypassed. However, the claims of the hacker for bitcoins by posting from celebrity accounts seems to be rather churlish. The hack may have been for something else and this incident is just acting as a cover?  Twitter has given a brief update on what has happened, but it is not entirely clear. Whether this would have some ramifications on the upcoming elections is something to watch out.

When a big company that has to answer investors every quarter wants to invest for the benefit of poor, it is a given there is more to it. First with Facebook and now Google , it is becoming fairly obvious that this investment is for more for getting access to the Indian market and the gatekeepers being Ambani and Jio. This is nothing but a high way toll to do business in India. And in the process both Amazon and Walmart - Flipkart has every reason to be worried.
