Well, I do not really remember when was the last time I blogged. I had my fair share of attempts at running a personal blog and tech focused blog long back. With the advent of Facebook and Twitter, I stopped blogging and the interest to write anything is restricted to mostly Twitter threads.

Genesis for this blog was triggered when I purchased a new .dev domain [Dinakaran](https://dinakaran.dev) a few days back. Even couple of years back, I registered one more domain and setup a single page profile using some free hosting provider. But beyond that, I lost interest to do anything.I hope this time I do something with this domain. 

I was looking for some blog hosting options which could help me to use my custom domain for the blog. Blogspot allowed it but the themes were limited. Wordpress and other providers had options but nothing was free. I wanted a very _Medium-ish_ design for a very minimal look and feel.I spent a really long time searching but could not zero in on any decent options.

Finally,in my twitter timeline somebody showed their new site built using Jekyll and I was super impressed. Also the fact that we could host the site from Github made it super interesting.
I had a look at the various free themes provided in Jekyll themes and finalized on this Medium like theme [Jekyll Theme](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/mediumish)

I hurriedly did a bit of basic customization to remove some bits and pieces and finally,here it is. I used [Prose](https://prose.io) online editor for content authoring that pushes the post into  GitHub easily. It is simple , nifty and easy to use.  

I do hope that this time around, I keep blogging without stopping after a couple of months. I have still not decided on what to blog so far.Let's see how it goes. Fingers crossed.

Cheers,
D
