### 3. TO-DO list is common. But have you tried To-LEARN list?

"Most people maintain a to-do list —a list of tasks that need to be completed in a day, week or month, typically organised in order of priority.
An effective to-do list can make a huge difference if you want to do your best work every day.

The same concept of crossing your most important things off your list can be used for learning anything — from skills to books.

You probably have some of the things you want to learn on your long to-do list. To increase your knowledge faster, create a separate to-learn list for everything you want to learn. "

### 4. Management Flywheel - Fixing the small issues and making the small win 


“The Flywheel” is a popular startup analogy, and is best described in this classic writeup. The flywheel is heavy and painful to start, and starts off slow, but as it gathers momentum over time it goes faster and faster. Turning around a team feels like getting this flywheel spinning. Most managers who see a team in a rut can quickly detect many things that are going wrong. But it’s the response to these problems that distinguishes the great ones."

### 5.Succeed in a negotiation yet save the face of your counterpart

"What exactly is face? In their classic work on politeness, Penelope Brown and Stephen C. Levinson define face as “the public self-image that every member of a society wants to claim for himself/herself.” Put differently, face is how people want to be perceived and connected to identity and dignity. When it comes to negotiation, it is about both sides preserving their and their organizations’ reputations."
