### 1. Now you can search for a song just by humming it to Google. Sounds cool, right?

I did try it a couple of times and it did work :) 

"Google is adding a new “hum to search” feature to its search tools today that will let you hum (or whistle, or sing) the annoying song that’s stuck in your head, and then use machine learning techniques to try to identify it."

### 2. 25 years of Gartner Hype Cycle 

"A chap called Mark used his COVID lockdown time to create a video representation of data scraped from 25 years of technology assessments from the Gartner hype cycle. Great to see how technology matures, and just how long something can be stuck in the 'about to happen' stage."

### 3. How to waste your career one comfortable year at a time. 

This one hit close to home.

"I recently saw this tweet asking people about their career's most expensive mistake. The most common one was people staying too long at their jobs and not switching sooner. I've seen people make this mistake over and over. Hell, I've made this mistake myself. Change can be scary. It requires you to get out of your comfort zone. But, in my experience, staying too long is one of the worst mistakes you can make in your career.

### 4. Emerging trends in Data Architectures

"Due to the energy, resources, and growth of the data infrastructure market, the tools and best practices for data infrastructure are also evolving incredibly quickly. So much so, it’s difficult to get a cohesive view of how all the pieces fit together. And that’s what we set out to provide some insight into. We asked practitioners from leading data organizations: (a) what their internal technology stacks looked like, and (b) whether it would differ if they were to build a new one from scratch."

### 5. API's VS SDK's - What's the difference?

"What is an API? What is an SDK? How are they related and enable users to streamline their cloud application development workflows? In this lightboard video, Nathan Hekman with IBM Cloud, answers these questions and much more while providing a real life scenario which explains the difference and similarities, and ultimately how the two technologies can work together to allow you to spend less time connecting/configuring a cloud service, and more time coding and actually using the service in your app."

### 1. IBM splitting up the company into two to focus on the cloud business.

"International Business Machines Corp is splitting itself into two public companies, capping a years-long effort by the world’s first big computing firm to diversify away from its legacy businesses to focus on high-margin cloud computing."

### 2. AppStore regulated by Government?  Deciding between Big Tech monopoly and Govt, it is a hard choice.

"India government is reportedly planning to develop its own App Store to end the duopoly of the mobile ecosystem by Google and Apple. In recent weeks, several start-ups and app-makers have been voicing concern over Google's policy, which made it mandatory for all developers to give 30% commission for all billings on apps registered on the Play store."

### 3. TO-DO list is common. But have you tried To-LEARN list?

"Most people maintain a to-do list —a list of tasks that need to be completed in a day, week or month, typically organised in order of priority.
An effective to-do list can make a huge difference if you want to do your best work every day.

The same concept of crossing your most important things off your list can be used for learning anything — from skills to books.

You probably have some of the things you want to learn on your long to-do list. To increase your knowledge faster, create a separate to-learn list for everything you want to learn. "

### 4. Management Flywheel - Fixing the small issues and making the small win 


“The Flywheel” is a popular startup analogy, and is best described in this classic writeup. The flywheel is heavy and painful to start, and starts off slow, but as it gathers momentum over time it goes faster and faster. Turning around a team feels like getting this flywheel spinning. Most managers who see a team in a rut can quickly detect many things that are going wrong. But it’s the response to these problems that distinguishes the great ones."

### 5.Succeed in a negotiation yet save the face of your counterpart

"What exactly is face? In their classic work on politeness, Penelope Brown and Stephen C. Levinson define face as “the public self-image that every member of a society wants to claim for himself/herself.” Put differently, face is how people want to be perceived and connected to identity and dignity. When it comes to negotiation, it is about both sides preserving their and their organizations’ reputations."
