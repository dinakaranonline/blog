Blinkist


Have you ever felt that reading books is generally a good habit and wanting to pursue,  but trying to read books or persisting with reading books on a regular basis is really tough. With fiction books , reading feels therpeuatic because of the world upon which the story revolves around making the reading super interesting and  fun. But with non-fiction books where the reading is aimed at getting something out of the book , it becomes really challengeing.

Some of the main reasons why reading non-fiction books feels like a chore is because 

1. We don't like reading books because the book does not seem to be interesting and we may have spent money on it. Having invested in a book that is not interesting and not completing it ever would become a mental block of not wanting to try a different book because we paid so much and have not read the first book. This is a real challenge and one of the main reason why we get stuck with reading. Kindle and Audible book subscriptions in some way help to avoid this challenge. 

2. Some books are really long and takes a lot of time to read the books and return on investment in terms of time does not feel justified. With non-fiction books , the ideas may be very interesting for good 40 - 80 pages, but there are lot of fluff filled in for good 400 pages to make it sell in book stores. Because most readers may have reserveations pay for a crisp 80 pages, but is fine with paying for 400 pages even if the essence is same.  


3. Main reason behind reading non-fiction books is to get something out of it. It may be self improvement or other interesting ideas that we may want to emulate in our life. While this is not necessary true with biographies and other kind of books , we tend to quickly forget the most essential good bits that we either loved or wanting to re-visit at a later point of time unless we document it as a summary.


So Blinkist is a service that helps to read a lot of non-fiction books and addressess some of the problems listed above . Idea is simple. Byte sized Book Summary in both text and audio form in the form of Blinks that would be anywhere between 10-15 mins that talks about the central idea and other essential critical bits that help to unravel the idea. There is a monthly subscription and you can listen to as many Blinks based on our interest. It is something like Audible but not reading the entire book for you, but some body summarising the book for you. Since there is an accompanying text that summarizes the book, one can book mark the interesting ideas and come back later to re-visit.  

After using the service for around 2 weeks and having listened to 8 books, here is what I feel are some of the positives. 

1. I like the idea of listening to a lot of interesting ideas from these non-fiction books in a really short span of time and not having to spend a really long time going through all the fluff.   

2. Since the time it takes to listen is less , I can listen to it more than once. I have listened for couple of books twice and it helped to drive the idea really well.

3. Recommendations and Trending Section are good ways to discover new and interesting books that I may have not un-covered it later. 

4. Some great books suggested as good reads was not that appealing to me when I listened to the summary. Had I bought the book , I may have got stuck because I would have not completed it and may have not proceeded to buying new books. If some book is not interesting or worth the time, there is not much to lose her since you are not paying for the book , but just the subscription. 

5. Bookmarks are really handy in case if I need to revisit the book and its central idea.

6. May be it is initial days of buying the service , but I'm listened to nearly 8 books and some of them are really good. Without this service , I may not have listened to these interesting days.  

Some of the cons :

1. Reality is , this is not equivalent of reading a book. It is some one else reading the book and summarizing the book. Quality of the summary is purely dependent on who does the summary and what kind of knowledge or context that person has. Some of the interesting ideas may get lost in the byte sized summary. With few books I really felt the idea was not summarized well. So it may be a hit or miss. 

2. Even with non-fiction books , some times the journey is as interesting as the idea. We tend to miss out on the wonderful journey and the context around which the central idea is communicated . Sometimes the summary may kill the soul if not interpreted the way it is meant to be interpreted. 

3. Every one choosing to read this service and not paying for the actual authors who put in blood and sweat to communicate feels like kind of cheating. I do not know if the service compensates the authors in anyway. 

The service also offers audio books like Audible , but that is not included as part of subscription and may need to build each book individually. I feel the best way to use the service is to listen to the summary and if the ideas feels interesting and make you curious and wanting to explore further , you may buy the actual book.


The service is also pivoting to original content , again in byte sized short summaries. Some of them are even 5-10 min long. They are not any books but ideas.

On whether I would want to use the service on a regular basis , only time can tell. But I feel the service fills a certain void with our habit of reading books. In the new digital age, are books the only way to communicate ideas? There are new forms like podcast and original ideas communicated as 5-10 min audio notes. It should be interesting to see how the service evolve given that it is has been already there for 5+ years , but am getting to hear about it in only 2020. Obviously authors would feel outraged about how their works is being crudely summarized making the ideas worse or the service monetizing their work. But it is a reality that there are so many good books / ideas that are being chruned out and we do not have all the time and money to experience them. And the service perfectly fits that void. 

End : 13: 12. 

Total time: 40 minutes.
