**Weekly Round-Up for the week ending 13th Sep, 2020**

**1. The Social Dilemma, a documentary on the perils of Social Media and smartphone addiction** 

Watched 'The Social Dilemma' on Netflix, a documentary about how social media and technology tend to manipulate people's attention, feelings and has the potential to destroy people/ democracy. From the same people who created these technologies and now wanting to take recourse. For a long time I believed, It is not the Technology stupid, it is we who are using it wrong. Although there is a truth to it, over the last year, I have slowly changed my opinion around this. Less screen time, less scrolling and less everything is the only solution now. We all need Digital Detox

**3.  Intelligent Minds Like Tim Cook and Jeff Bezos Embrace the Rule of Awkward Silence.** 

"That may sound like a lot for 10 to 20 seconds, but you'll be surprised what your brain can accomplish once it's given a little more time to do what it was designed to do: think things through. So, the next time someone asks you a challenging question, or even what seems on the surface to be a simple one, resist the temptation to respond with the first thing that comes to mind.
Instead, embrace the rule of awkward silence, and think before you speak."

**5.  Amazon is filled with fake reviews and it’s getting harder to spot them**

"Since Amazon’s early days, reviews are the one big metric customers have relied on to determine the quality and authenticity of a product. Amazon’s listings often have hundreds or thousands of reviews, instead of the handful found on competing marketplaces. But many of those reviews can’t be trusted. Thousands of fake reviews have flooded Amazon, Walmart, eBay and others, as sales have skyrocketed."

**2. Interesting observations on the Generalists vs Specialists**

"The author’s research shows that generalists often find their path or true calling late, and they juggle many interests rather than focusing on one. As a result, they tend to be more creative, more agile, and able to make connections their more specialized peers can’t see."

And now, the venerable Tata Group — not to be left behind in the race for India’s trillion dollar digital economy — wants one."

**5. Ikigai is the reason to be and reason to live**

"The Japanese have a beautiful concept to guide their lives called ikigai. I learned it from karate masters on the beautiful Japanese islands of Okinawa. Researchers have claimed ikigai is the reason why the islands have the highest density of 100-year-olds in the world.
Ikigai is the reason to be and reason to live."
