**2. Interesting observations on the Generalists vs Specialists**

"The author’s research shows that generalists often find their path or true calling late, and they juggle many interests rather than focusing on one. As a result, they tend to be more creative, more agile, and able to make connections their more specialized peers can’t see."

**3.The Race to Build a ‘desi’ Super App**

"Every tech CEO wants a Super App. In the post-Covid world, they want one. Yesterday. Google Pay is building one, WhatsApp needs one, Amazon is dabbling in it, Jio is putting one together, Flipkart (and Phonepe), and Paytm are the other contenders. And now, the venerable Tata Group — not to be left behind in the race for India’s trillion dollar digital economy — wants one."

**5. Ikigai is the reason to be and reason to live**

"The Japanese have a beautiful concept to guide their lives called ikigai. I learned it from karate masters on the beautiful Japanese islands of Okinawa. Researchers have claimed ikigai is the reason why the islands have the highest density of 100-year-olds in the world.
Ikigai is the reason to be and reason to live."
