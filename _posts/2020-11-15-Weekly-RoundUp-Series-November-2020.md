## Interesting articles that I read for the week ending 15th Nov,2020


### 1. WTF is Commercial Open Source Software?

"The majority of Commercial Open Source Software companies have built their business model in a way that allows them to capture part of the value that is delivered by their open-source core product, by offering commercial versions of their products, alternative license options, or add-on proprietary software. While their success still fundamentally depends on their open-source core technology.

### 2. OTT censorship on the cards - It was good while it lasted? 

"Films have to be cleared by a censor board; print media and TV news have self-regulatory bodies like the Press Council and the News Broadcasters Association, and commercials adhere by the Advertising Standards Council (ASCI). Further, TV programming came under the ambit of the Cable Networks Regulation Act.

That situation will change now, with the I&B ministry now getting the power to regulate policies dictating, if needed, what should be shown or uploaded online and what should not be. While the immediate thought would be that this order is aimed at OTT providers like Netflix and Amazon and their brand of web series’ featuring copious amounts of violence, nudity and coarse language, the sweeping scope of this new law reaches much further, into the very foundations of a free media. 
In one stroke, virtually all content available on the internet, not just web serials but news and opinions, now come under government monitoring. I&B ministry officials were quoted saying this new order is an enabling mandate to enforce ‘greater discipline online."

### 3. Capping on the 30% market share in UPI - UPI Stifling innovation

"The NPCI claimed the cap will help address risks emanating from the overload of the payments infrastructure and protect the UPI ecosystem from monopolies, but there’s been some push back from Google Pay and PhonePe, which currently occupy over 80% UPI market share together.
Critics of the new policy claim it will only stymie innovation in the UPI space and complicate matters for consumers in the long run. There are also questions about how it will work for the apps that go beyond UPI payments, as most of the bigger apps do. But beyond that, there is a feeling that this unprecedented move could change the whole UPI game altogether."

### 4.  BigBasket Data Breach and importance of Data Classification 

"A report by IBM revealed that out of 17 countries surveyed, the cost of data breach resulted in a loss of $3.92 million on an average. The loss incurred in case of a data breach extends way beyond financial losses. It results in possible data theft, causes loss of millions, in some cases billions of private records and sensitive data, affecting not only the organisation but also individuals whose information may have been stolen. Hence, it goes without saying that organisations must have strong data protection techniques in place. One of the major techniques is data classification.

Data classification is a process of organising data by relevant categories for efficient usage and protection of data. It helps data security, compliance, and risk management. Experts advise that companies must invest in strong data classification policy to protect their data from breaches."

### 5. Machine Learning Behind the 'Hum to Search' 

"Hum to Search is a new fully machine-learned system within Google Search that allows a person to find a song using only a hummed rendition of it. In contrast to existing methods, this approach produces an embedding of a melody from a spectrogram of a song without generating an intermediate representation. This enables the model to match a hummed melody directly to the original (polyphonic) recordings without the need for a hummed or MIDI version of each track or for other complex hand-engineered logic to extract the melody. This approach greatly simplifies the database for Hum to Search, allowing it to constantly be refreshed with embeddings of original recordings from across the world — even the latest releases."

### 1. Adapting Search to Indian Phonetics

"These new customers are different from the previous set of urban customers. They have strong connections with their regional and cultural aspects, which influence their purchase needs. They prefer the use of their regional languages and dialects for communication and are largely less proficient in English. Hence, we decided to improve our way of understanding search query tokens to help serve these customers better."

### 3. WhatsApp UPI is  launching officially

"The launch of WhatsApp's payment services marks the culmination of a long journey that included court cases, and concerns over data localisation as well as the risk of monopoly of the ubiquitous app, which has over 400 million users in India."

### 4. Skill is not the same as talent

"If we cared enough, we could learn. If we cared enough, we would practice. And if we cared enough, we’d show up again and again until the skill was ours. “Talent” is an insult to anyone who has ever developed a skill. It’s yours if you want it."

### 5. The Tech Behind "Watch Hotstar, Watch your friends!"

"It’s friends and families that make live sports more entertaining with their custom live commentary. This year, we’ve launched a “‘Watch with Friends” feature, which is essentially a video chat along with match. Now you can watch live matches along with your friends and families and share each every moment of the action with them!"
