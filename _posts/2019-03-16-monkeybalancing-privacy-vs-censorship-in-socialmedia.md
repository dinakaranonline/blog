## Monkey Balancing Privacy vs Censorship in Social Media

![camera-cctv-cyber-430208 (2).jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/_posts/camera-cctv-cyber-430208 (2).jpg)


Ever since the dawn of social media , there are some kind of protest over how Social Media works. Initially it started with censorship policies and all of us were super criticial about any kind of censorship. 

Governments all over the world would want to peep through what is discussed and tried to bring various sort of regulations unsucessfully about what is written about them etc. Some how the Freedom of Expression won that round to a great extent. 

Privacy is also another aspect where-in we wanted to ensure anonymity in how we communicate and to whom we communicate . This has resulted in a safer space for whistleblowers and media to report un-heard stores before.

### Dawn of Fake News/ Hatred and Trolls

But as social media grew by leaps and bounds in the last decade , so does the emergence of fake news. Fake news had a very important role to play in forming up governments in US of A and for the Brexit campaign too. 

Fake news has also resulted in far reaching consequences in India. Combined with hate news , this has become a major problem through out the world. With privacy and end to end encyrption ,it is becoming a challenge as to how to control the flow of fake or hatred news.

Trolls have become another big part of the online hatred movement visiciated atmosphere thereby rendering social media a rather not-so-safe space for people, especially women. 

There is now growing calls over regulation in social media on a wide variety of topics, starting from fake news to hate content to banning trolls etc. And this space is getting trickier by the way as it is very difficult to get into a consensus on what is allowed vs banned. Almost every social media company is walking on a thin-line and every such decision will be debated making the process slow, cumbersome and tiring.

### What do we need from Social Media?


So we have now at a point where we are no longer sure about what we expect out of social media ? Do we need censorship or freedom of expression ? Do we need less regulation or more ? Do we need more privacy or the other way around ? I'm not sure anymore. What is sure is that , social media is still evolving and the extent to which these online platforms could be used for good or bad is not fully realized. As we progress further , there may be newer beasts yet to be unleashed upon us.As we move along , it is very important to understand the bigger picture  and frame our understanding in an informed way. It is imperative on all of us to understand the impacts and balance that is required for all of us to use social media in the most possible way. Wishing or propogating for anything extreme would be severely limiting the wonderful medium. 

The bigger question that will be asked is : Censorship vs Freedom of Expression. Privacy vs Accountability . Less regulation vs More regulation. I would like to believe none of us would have any easy answers to all of these questions - we have to monkey balance based on context, purpose , intent and host of other important considerations.
