Interesting reads for this week of 9th August 2020.

### 1. Bjyu's have  acquired White Hat Junior for a whopping 200 million

[https://www.businessinsider.in/business/startups/news/how-karan-bajaj-sold-his-less-than-18-month-old-startup-white-hat-jr-to-byjus/articleshow/77415329.cms](https://www.businessinsider.in/business/startups/news/how-karan-bajaj-sold-his-less-than-18-month-old-startup-white-hat-jr-to-byjus/articleshow/77415329.cms)

White Hat Junior is using the NIIT playbook of the 90's by taking the idea of learning to code for kids starting from the age of 7. An 18-month start-up selling for this high of a valuation is a reflection of the growing relevance of tech industry and parents too have started jumping into the bandwagon of getting kids to learn coding at a young age. My daughter too enrolled onto one introductory session and after she performing exceedingly well, the scholarship offer stood at 90K for a period of 3 or 6 months. LOL. One reason for the high cost is that all the sessions are 1-1 and it is claimed to be more effective. 

Personalized learning is the next big frontier in education. Looking back, teachers trying to teach for a class of 30 always mean some kids can never understand concepts well, but can never get it clarified due to some reasons. Personalized learning either through video content with unlimited playback or 1-1 could make for a more engaging experience. It is also one of the main reason Zuckerberg invested in Byju's.

But the cringy advts by White Hat Junior featuring Sundar Pichai unofficially certainly feels hilariously stupid at so many levels.

### 2. Memories of Amazon employees working with Jeff Bezos building Kindle 

This walkthrough down the memory lane of employees working with Jeff Bezos to build the first version of Kindle has amazing insights into the kind of person Jeff Bezos is. Hindsight is 20-20, but to have conviction and follow it up ruthlessly is no small deal. Especially when there are challenges directed at them from multiple fronts. 3.5 years to roll out the first version of Kindle with 10000 titles is amazing at so many levels.

### 3. Do not steal the code, you may get jailed for real. 

This saga of a Google Engineer stealing self-driving car secrets and then joining Uber to build the same for the company has finally come to a close with 18-month prison. Do not steal the code, respect IP.

### 4. Covid, Mulan and Disney++ 

Disney has done an excellent catch-up on their  Transformation to Digital with their streaming services on fire. I have subscribed to it and my daughter loves it big time. Now Disney is trying to push the button further. The much-awaited big-budget kid's movie, Mulan is set to be directly going to the Disney stream. The only catch, it is going to cost 29$ to watch the movie even if you have Disney+. Well, that is quite some business model out there that Disney is testing its water.

### 5. Are the smartphone and smart speakers mic always ON? Well, no one can confirm at the moment.

 I work in technology and I can confirm with absolute honesty that I do not understand the limits the big techs are pushing here day-in, day-out. 

"Last week, Reddit user Brazedowl received a curious notification on his phone: Google was telling him that a smoke detector in his home had gone off. Brazedowl, a teacher from North Carolina who goes by Drew in real life, knew about the smoke alarm â€” he was at home himself and had just fried some sausages in his kitchen. But up until that moment, he had no idea that his smart speaker was able to detect such events. "Google just made my dumb smoke detectors smart," he wrote on Reddit. "Pretty rad."
