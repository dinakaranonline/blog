Some time back I wrote a [post](https://dinakaran.dev/blog/How-to-find-useful-content-to-read-on-a-daily-basis/) about how I find useful content to read on a daily basis. In this post, I would want to dive deep on how I read content on things about AWS. 

Most of us wanting to venture into AWS will probably start with enrolling in online courses in sites like Udemy, Pluralsight etc and may be running a few code samples, personal project and then complete certification. While it may be a good start, most of the time the learning may stop there if there is no clear path on what next. So this post is an attempt to address this.  The following are the AWS resources that I usually follow to get regular updates on all things AWS. 

 ### 1. AWS This is My Architecture video series 

A short 5 video youtube video series that talks about the various different type of architecture that is built by different companies on top of AWS.  Subscribe to this youtube channel

### 2. AWS Webinars / Online Conferences and Events 

AWS from time to time organizes live webinars and online conferences on various topics in AWS. This is entirely free. Most of these online sessions are hosted in Twitch and recorded versions are in youtube. Once the sign up is done for the webinar series, constant updates on the upcoming events happen from time to time arrive at the mailbox promptly. The previous years Re-Invent videos are a good way to get more detailed updates about the product, releases etc.

### 3. AWS Youtube channel / AWS  Serverless channel 

AWS Youtube is constantly bombarded with too many videos that it be really difficult to follow. But official youtube channel may clutter youtube subscription. There is a dedicated Serverless youtube channel too started recently and that can be followed to get new videos published on the live channel.

### 4. AWS Developer Advocates 

For almost every service of AWS, there are Developer Advocates and their prime responsibility is to spread the word around regarding the service through documentation, videos, webinars, blogs videos etc. They are also quite active on social media. I have interacted with few of them and most of them respond promptly when asked for any queries.

### 5. AWS  Hero Program 

AWS has the  Hero Program that showcases people who are doing a lot of work in the AWS space and spreading the word around the internet through blog posts, tutorials etc. Following these interesting people and their work on the AWS from across the world is also a good way to follow up on the latest and greatest in AWS.

### 5. Podcasts 

There are a number of podcasts that one can find on AWS. The ones I follow are the official AWS  Podcasts. In addition to it, the ones that I regularly follow are Screaming In The Cloud, Serverless Chats, Burning Monk, Mobycast, Cloudanaut etc. Podcasts are a good way to follow things around AWS and when combined with a work out routine will make it easier to follow and keep track of it.

2. AWS Conversations with Leaders: [https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/podcast/](https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/podcast/)

### 6. Newsletters 

Most of the podcasters also have a newsletter that land in my inbox every week. Last Week In AWS by Corey Quinn, Serverless Chats are some of the most active ones.

### 7. Local AWS Meetups 

Local AWS Meetups are organized via the Meetup platform. Search for meetup groups in the city that you live in, there is every chance that there is a meetup group active. I have been to a couple of meetups and they are a good way to network with other AWS enthusiasts

### 8. Stack Overflow 

Most of the AWS related queries are constantly monitored in Stack OverFlow by AWS Developer Advocates and are responded immediately. Following Stack Overflow on any topic of interest within AWS is another good way to understand the use-cases people are trying to solve with various services in AWS and the common problems and solutions to each of them.

I think the learning courses in Udemy, Pluralsight are a good way to get started. And following up with a simple personal project would be nice too. But these online resources get delivered in my mailbox, Twitter timeline or Youtube subscription or Podcasts. Even though I receive a lot of content, I consume a maximum of 10 %. I filter ruthlessly based on the topics that I want to explore in AWS and prioritize accordingly.

I will try to keep updating this list as and when I find new interesting content to follow on AWS.
