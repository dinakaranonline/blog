Happy New Year 2021. Wishing the readers of this blog a warm and joyful 2021. Continuing with the weekly round up series in 2021 as well. 

**1.Alphabet is shutting down Loon, its internet balloon company**

Launched with a lot of promise as one of the biggest bet of Google X, it is sad to see Project Loon biting the dust after Google Glass.

**2.Elastic vs AWS fight over Elastic Search Open Source project**

The tension between Open Source and Cloud Providers have no end in sight at the moment? Changes to licensing terms and using Open Source to build a profitable business could be a recurring challenge. On the other side, Cloud Providers are trying to build products on top of Open Source offerings as a Managed Service thereby squeeing any little money that Open Source maintainers were planning to make from maintaining the project. All this makes the relationship very messy.

**3.Repository of many workshops created by AWS** 

"This website lists workshops created by the teams at Amazon Web Services (AWS). Workshops are hands-on events designed to teach or introduce practical skills, techniques, or concepts which you can use to solve business problems. "

**4. Context switching costs more than we give it credit for**

"When I was a junior engineer, one of the best advice I got from a seasoned principal engineer was to batch things, stack rank them in preferred order (by time, size, impact, or priority), and execute. And, be careful when batching them. Batching them by function increases productivity as it minimizes context switching cost."

**5. Serverless Adoption: Is Cost Still The Main Factor?**

"Serverless has successfully won many businesses over within its relatively shorter existence. As a technology, several use cases have proven the versatility of serverless. A plethora of new use cases is being built with confidence and comfort every day. Its cost centered typecasting is changing.

The challenge, however, is to maintain its simplicity amidst all the sophistication. The simplicity is what makes it convenient for everyone to build solutions faster.

Perhaps it is time for a new tagline for serverless. Let Convenience Computing be that one as serverless confidently marches ahead in the right direction into the future!"

Here are the list of interesting content that I read on the web, for the week ending 17th January 2021. 

**1. Forty and Still a software developer?**

"Many of us live this horrific nightmare. The fear is being put out to pasture. Has the industry knighted young people as the stewards of technology? It’s natural to doubt yourself and wonder if you can do this any longer.

Management rewards heroic late-night efforts, but what about productive output? What about the experiences you bring to the table?
You want to compete, but not at the expense of your family. And how do you compete with colleagues who sleep at the office?"

**2.Business schools do not teach the fundamental problems of business**

"That’s pretty bad, right? What they teach are finance, what they teach is marketing, they teach us HR. As the greatest management thinker of all time, Peter Drucker said, “There are no marketing problems, there are no finance problems, there are no accounting problems, there are only business problems.” These are problems that sloppily span across a bunch of domains and business education has abdicated, doesn’t even try to teach how you think across domains."

Good news. It does not matter even if 99.9 % of people in India cannot afford a Tesla :)

**6. The trap of "I want to do something important"**

"One common trap for smart people is "I want to do something important". In reality, most world-changing things happen not because we planned and anticipated them but because our passionate efforts in seemingly unimportant projects evolved to make those projects important."
