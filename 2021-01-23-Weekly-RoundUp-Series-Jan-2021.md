Listen of interesting content that I read on the web, for the week ending 17th January 2021. 

**1. Forty and Still a software developer? **

"Many of us live this horrific nightmare. The fear is being put out to pasture. Has the industry knighted young people as the stewards of technology? It’s natural to doubt yourself and wonder if you can do this any longer.

**2.Business schools do not teach the fundamental problems of business**

"That’s pretty bad, right? What they teach are finance, what they teach is marketing, they teach us HR. As the greatest management thinker of all time, Peter Drucker said, “There are no marketing problems, there are no finance problems, there are no accounting problems, there are only business problems.” These are problems that sloppily span across a bunch of domains and business education has abdicated, doesn’t even try to teach how you think across domains."

**6. The trap of "I want to do something important"**

"One common trap for smart people is "I want to do something important". In reality, most world-changing things happen not because we planned and anticipated them but because our passionate efforts in seemingly unimportant projects evolved to make those projects important."
